# Data Structure and Algorithms

A data structure is a way of organizing, storing and accessing data. Algorithms are a step-by-step approach to solving a problem, a set of instructions that tells a computer what to do.

## Big O 
This helps us to vet the efficiency of an algorithm. It tells us how long an algorithm will take to run or how much data will need to be handled as the input grows

## 0(n)
this is a linear time algorithm whereby as the input size increases, the execution time increases

## 0(1) 
this is a constant time algorithm whereby as the input size increases, the execution time remains constant

## 0(n^2)
this indicates that the algorithm's execution time grows quadratically with the size of input data. 

## 0(log n) 
this refers to an algorithm who's runtime grows logarithmically with the size of th input
